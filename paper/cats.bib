abstract = {We define the phrase ‘category enriched in an fc-multicategory’ and explore some examples. An fc-multicategory is a very general kind of two-dimensional structure, special cases of which are double categories, bicategories, monoidal categories and ordinary multicategories. Enrichment in an fc-multicategory extends the (more or less well-known) theories of enrichment in a monoidal category, in a bicategory, and in a multicategory. Moreover, fc-multicategories provide a natural setting for the bimodules construction, traditionally performed on suitably cocomplete bicategories. Although this paper is elementary and self-contained, we also explain why, from one point of view, fc-multicategories are the natural structures in which to enrich categories.}

The result allows data structures to be realized not only in the category of continuous lattices, but also in the category of complete lattices, in the category of complete partial orders, or in any of several related categories of partial orders.}

Just as LCF is a logic for the simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus with recursion and arithmetic, our logic is a logic for System F. The logic permits the formal presentation and use of relational parametricity. Parametricity yields-for example-encodings of initial algebras, final co-algebras and abstract datatypes, with corresponding proof principles of induction, co-induction and simulation.",
