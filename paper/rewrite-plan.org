* FoSSaCs rewrite

1. Shorten it to 18 pages, with full figures moved into appendices.
2. What technical stuff is left to do?

   The model stuff needs to be re-written in terms of virtual
   equipments and needs to incorporate small and locally small
   categories

* New Outline
** Title/Abstract (currenlty 0.5 page)
** Intro (currently 5 pages) (shorter?)
** Syntax (currently 7) (shorter?)

** Synthetic Category Theory (currently 3)    (shorter?)
** Model Theory (currently 3.5) (shorter?)
** Discussion (currently 2.5) (shorter!)

** References (currently 0 oops)

* Last minute

Discussion: enriched vs dependent and comparison to Verity-Riehl

* TODO Appendix [0%]

- [-] Syntax
  1. [X] typing rules for substitution etc
  2. [ ] descriptions of different operations like \jnctx (some of these are in semantics currently)
  3. [X] substitution in functors/profunctors/elements
  4. [X] equational theory
  5. [ ] admissibility of general identity elimination (syntax or semantics?)
- [ ] Examples
  1. [ ] Compositions/naturality
  2. [ ] Fubini
  3. [ ] Adjoints
  4. [ ] Weighted limits?
- [ ] Semantics
  1. [ ] rewrite to be about virtual equipments rather than DCDs.
  2. [ ] add in UMP for presheaves and tabulators
  3. [ ] decide which soundness/completeness results to include
