Add support for monoidal category theory

Focus on an application: Operational Logical Relations(!)

Define, say, a "formal" CBPV LR and get many models:

1. Ordinary categories: normalization proof
2. Internal to Topos of trees: guarded normalization proof
3. Enriched version: subtyping?!?
4. Internal version: gradual typing?
5. Indexed verions??
