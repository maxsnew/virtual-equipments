We present a type theory for constructions and proofs in category
theory. The type theory axiomatizes notions of category, functor,
profunctor and a generalized form of natural transformations. By
restricting the type theory to an ordered linear variant of predicate
logic, we guarantee that all functions between categories are
functorial, all relations are profunctorial, and all transformations
are natural by construction, with no separate proof
necessary. Important category theoretic proofs such as the Yoneda
lemma become simple type theoretic proofs about the relationship
between unit, tensor and function types, and can be seen to be ordered
refinements of familiar theorems in predicate logic.

The type theory comes with a sound and complete notion of categorical
model based on virtual equipments, a known setting for formal category
theory that has been shown to model internal, enriched and indexed
category theory. This means that while the proofs in our type theory
look like standard set-based arguments, the syntactic discipline
ensures that all proofs and constructions carry over to these
generalized settings as well.
